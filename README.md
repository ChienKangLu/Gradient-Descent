# Gradient-Descent
Gradient-Descent is an algorithm used to find the the minimum of a function. An arbitrary point will move along with opposite direction according to its slope until it arrive to the minimum position.

## Step
1. Choose an arbitrary point
2. Calculate its derivative
3. Move to the opposite direction
4. Update to a new point

## Example
