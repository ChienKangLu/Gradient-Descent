# Gradient-Descent
Gradient-Descent is an algorithm used to find the the minimum of a function. An arbitrary point will move along with opposite direction according to its slope until it arrive to the minimum position.

## Step
1. Choose an arbitrary point
2. calculate its derivative
3. move to the opposite direction
4. update to a new point

## Example
