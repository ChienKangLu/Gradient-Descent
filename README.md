# Gradient-Descent
Gradient-Descent is an algorithm used to find the the minimum of a function. An arbitrary point will move along with opposite direction according to its slope until it arrive to the minimum position.

## Step
1. Choose an arbitrary point
2. Calculate the derivative of function on this point
3. Calculate the gradient by negative of derivative and a very small learning rate
3. Move to a new point according to the gradient
4. Until maximum iteration or very small change

## Example
